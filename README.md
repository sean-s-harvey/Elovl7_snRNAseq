# Elovl7_snRNAseq
Here you can find all jupyter notebooks used for analyzing our Elovl7 single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNAseq) dataset. Specifically, we sequenced the transcriptomes of all cells captured within cortical isolates from Elovl7 conditional knockout (cKO) mice and litter-mate controls in the context of health, as well as two timepoints after injection with the systemic inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Therefore, this allows us to compare how loss of Elovl7 impacts gene expression in the brain at the single-nucleus level, and allows us to determine how loss of Elovl7 affects neuroinflammatory responses. 

For droplet-based snRNAseq, libraries were prepared using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3' HT v3.1 according to the manufacturer's protocol (10x Genomics), targeting 20,000 nuclei per sample. Final snRNAseq libraries were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq X Plus at the UCSD IGM Genomics Center.
